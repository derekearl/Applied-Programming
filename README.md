# Overview

Hello my name is Derek Earl and I am Software Engineering Student at Brigham Young University-Idaho and I am seeking to learn
more about programming, and applying into a real world setting, and maybe along the way come up with something could benefit
humanity along the way, or simply just make life a lot smoother.

Below is a simple Python program that will display Hello World, a simple piece of code that most developers start off learning how to 
code.

The purpose of this is to demonstrate a simple line code and show that programming is a lot easier than it looks.

Here is a short video on how to write a basic program in the Python Language

# Development Environment

I chose to use VS Code as my IDE for this simple demonstration because it is easy to use and free.

I chose Python as the language to show, becuase it is an easy language to start learning with.
