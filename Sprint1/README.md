# Overview

Here is a program that contains an exercise that is used by many Speech Pathologists when doing an evaluation on a patient. 

I used the Java Programming Language to write this exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to learn a new programming language and research on my own how to write a complex program in a new language.

Below is a video on how the program works.

# Development Environment

I chose to use the IDE Visual Studio Code for this program.

Besides Java I imported a few utilities such as arrays, list, random, and scanner.
