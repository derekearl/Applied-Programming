# Overview

{This section is a basic practice program that I wrote to familiarize myself with the C++ language.}

{I used the software Visual Studio Code to write the actual software but due to it not having a compiler built in I used Microsoft Visual Studio
to run the code that I wrote.}

{This was a practice run in learning C++ and transfering different knowledge from other codding languages and applying to C++.}

# Development Environment

{All the tools I used were Visual Studio Code to write the code and save it, and Visual Studio to run the actual code.}

{I used the Programming Language C++ and I wanted to include iostream, string, and vector at the beginning of my code.}

# Future Work

{Here is a list of things I will add to the program to make it better.}

- Replace random words in the input instead of starting from the beginning and just replacing the next word.
- Have the user type out the passage they are attempting to memorize when the words all dissappear
- Make it to where multiple things can typed in to memorize.
