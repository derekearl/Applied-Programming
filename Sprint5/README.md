This a practice using a database to gain experience and test out different ways of storing data.

# Cloud Database

I will be using MongoDB for this project.

I store data using a JSON document in VSCode and put it the database for storage.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode and MongoDB for this and installed express and various other software
in the terminal.

JavaScript and JSON were the only programming languages used.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work


- I need to get it to delete data as needed.
- I will need to use another Database that is related to the other one.
- I will use the other features of MongoDB as well.
